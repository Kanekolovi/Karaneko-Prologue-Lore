- [ ] Link notes to any other notes they may relate to, indicate and annotate how they may be related and build upon the story.
- [ ] Create a plan and script for how the video will be formatted.
- [ ] Gather B-roll shots of relevant images/videos which may be needed for the visuals of the video.
- [ ] Record audio of the script, incorporate sound effects and decide what music should go at what parts for atmospheric effect.
- [ ] Edit footage/audio together, ensure that the end product is satisfactory.
- [ ] Ensure all people who assisted are duly recorded in the credits.
- [ ] Publish video
- [ ] ~~receive free Yurim plushies from the dev team for our hard work and effort~~
