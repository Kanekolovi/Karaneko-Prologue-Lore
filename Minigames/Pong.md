- A classic solo game of pong, with three difficulty settings that change the speed of the opponent.

- The rebound of the ball is random and unpredictable
- As the ball goes faster, it goes straighter, leaving more chance for the opponent to catch. In hard mode you will win mostly in the beginning.
