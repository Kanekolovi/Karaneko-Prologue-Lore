- Likes [[Yurim]]
- Has seen hard times...
- Has a cleaning obsession (cf. [[Karam's Cleaning OCD]]), since [[The Incident]].
- Doesn’t smile very much since the incident. Yet, you can smile at [[Ark]]’s face when he fights you. That smile is interpreted by Ark as the gang being a joke to Karam. Karam’s reason to smile is left to the player. Maybe it is a smile caused by remembering the old times (imagination).

- Likes Reira, the game character. He is a Gamer!

----Smaller Things of note----
Has eaten too much junk food lately, proably because of depression.
- Before getting Yurim, he was fond of dogs.
