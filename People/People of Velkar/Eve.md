-  Red fox lady 
-  seems generally angry (albeit we do enter her bedroom uninvited in the middle of the night)
- seems to be the most powerful between herself, Laschka, Luminyan and Karam (given how she fights all 3 at once)  
- associated most with the color red ( whereas l Luminyan is yellow, Laschka is blue etc,)
- Is the leader of a gang in ryujin and seeks to overthrow the current order (seen via the karaneko kickstarter when talking about the hakure route)
- Eve’s eye color appears to be a combination of red green and yellow (Likely from her part fox heritage)
