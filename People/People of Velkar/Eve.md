-  Red fox lady, is [[Laschka]]’s cousin
-  seems generally angry (albeit we do enter her bedroom uninvited in the middle of the night)
- seems to be the most powerful between herself, Laschka, Luminyan and Karam (given how she fights all 3 at once)  (we also know this from her robe’s “glow”)
- She is also the senior of [[The Dorm]].
- associated most with the color red (whereas Luminyan is yellow, Laschka is blue etc,)
- Is the leader of a gang in [[Ryuujin]] and seeks to overthrow the current order (seen via the karaneko kickstarter when talking about the [[Hakure route]])
- Eve’s eye color appears to be a combination of red green and yellow (Likely from her part fox heritage) 
- Knows about the wolf based on its scent sticking onto Karam and scolds you for not killing it (as seen in the ending where you leave Yurim to die)
- Likes listening to quality music and hates being disturbed in her listening sessions. (Caturday news)
- There is a fox tail pattern on her cloak.
- Her cloak is red, a rather strong color.
- Her room is clean
