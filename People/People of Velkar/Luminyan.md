- Is protective of his belongings, as hinted by the note on a shelf in [[The Dorm]].

In front of his door:
	- Notices that “You are quite vigorous”… 
	- States his room is messy and that he is tired as an excuse to not let Karam come in (while having cold sweat). Yet, we meet him shortly after for the [[Training session]]. What a liar…

He conducted a ritual in his room: 
- In-game we can see the remains of a doll used for the ritual, with black strands of hair in it.
- In the 8/2/2025 CN entry is described the event. [write moar]

Him bringing up the health of Karam hints at the idea that his ritual was meant to hurt [[Karam (Velkar)]] in some way.
