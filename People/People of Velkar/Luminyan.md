- Is protective of his belongings, as hinted by the note on a shelf in [[The Dorm]].
- His distinctive symbol



In front of his door:
	- Notices that “You are quite vigorous”… 
	- States his room is messy and that he is tired as an excuse to not let Karam come in (while having cold sweat). Yet, we meet him shortly after for the [[Training session]]. What a liar…

He conducted a [[Luminyan's Ritual|ritual]] in his room: 
- In-game we can see the remains of a doll used for the ritual, with black strands of hair in it.
- In the 8/2/2025 CN entry is described the event. [write moar]

Him bringing up the health of Karam hints at the idea that his ritual was meant to hurt [[Karam (Velkar)]] in some way.

- A slip of mouth indicates he doesn’t like [[Laschka]]? He was ordered by his teacher to take care of him. But also he refers to him as “my dear friend” (potentially hypocrite).

- His route is the “Hypocrita” route. Surely he’s hypocrite and hides a lot of secrets from everyone.
