“The librarian”

Was once able to come and go freely to the Pink Forest, but suddenly stopped (maybe something happened to him)

Brought the first seed of the pink trees
He said they turn into ‘something you’ll really love’ (no color when emotionally unstable = lose it’s property?)
- Is the reason why the forest went from green to pink

Told Yurim that the black flowers bring people closer together

Has left [[Vegoia]] for [[Ninova]] (Based on the striking resemblance between missing poster and characters of Rabbit route, and the fact that we search for him in Ninova (as told by [[KickStarter]]))
→Probably why he didn’t come visit Yurim anymore
