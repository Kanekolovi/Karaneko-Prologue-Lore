- [[Karam (Velkar)]] is Laschka’s new friend :)
- Has been here for a while in his ~~sister~~ cousin [[Eve]]’s room.
- [[Luminyan]]’s teacher ordered him personally to take care of Laschka.
- Laschka comes from Far lands so he knows English but is still struggling with the language sometimes as he speaks with simple sentences.

- Likes fighting :3
- Barks like a dog sometimes (in the fight)
- Sleeps on a bed used for pets, there is a broken bone and magicaster in it.

Combat playstyle:
- WASD to shoot projectiles
- Does not use magic, instead, Luminyan’s magic may restore his health 
- Eats food at the beginning of a turn
