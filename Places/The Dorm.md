The dorm is where you spend the second part of the prologue, in [[The academy]]. Despite being very similar in layout to [[Karam's Home]], it is a very contrasting change of atmosphere. dark at night and is still in winter, every item description is very cold and short unlike the descriptions in IRL that were always commented upon by someone or Karam’s own memories tied to it. 
[[Luminyan]], [[Karam]], [[Eve]] and [[Laschka]] live there.




It being winter and at night confirms the isekaisation is temporally coherent and quick.
