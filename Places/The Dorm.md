The dorm is where you spend the second part of the prologue, in [[The academy]]. Despite being very similar in layout to [[Karam's Home]], it is a very contrasting change of atmosphere. dark at night and is still in winter, every item description is very cold and short unlike the descriptions in IRL that were always commented upon by someone or Karam’s own memories tied to it. 
[[Luminyan]], [[Karam (Velkar)]], [[Eve]] and [[Laschka]] live there.




It being winter and at night confirms the isekaisation is temporally coherent and quick.

The mirror in the corridor reflects a **stranger** version of you upon seeing your new “Academy” look. This implies Karam is aware of his physical changes and finds that strange too.

The Carpet on the floor of the corridor has the same logo as the green book in [[Yurim's house]]. This implies that [[Finnion]] sourced his books from [[Vegoia]].






Books in the main living area:
	- ”The sun cat” 「“A horror story that will pierce the desperate entirety of your sanity, by a kitty inside the camera”」
	- A completely burned book 
	- “Magic for beginners” → The cloak, gained when you aquire magic powers, is a visual representation of the amount of magic power. The greater the power, the brighter it will be., darker shades indicating a lower power. → Karam has no magic power. (He throws the wand lol)
	- “The history and Philosophy of Suda” 「”…When the seasons changed, the pitiful humankind could not survive. How desperate and powerless the humanity was!” “Yet the [[Desirée - God of Wisdom|Wise One]] believed them, that miserable creatures. Thus, the knowledge is granted to the mankind”  “ So much so that not a single trace of ignorance remains…”」→ the [[Desirée - God of Wisdom|Wise One]] giving humanity knowledge is reminiscent of the apple of knowledge eaten by Adam and Eve, this imagery is present in the Kickstarter presentation of Hypocrita Route , with a scene of Désirée in front of a tree with what looks like apples. In that scene Vegoia is becoming tainted by something, the apples too.
