While Karam’s Room here has a very similar layout to [[Karam's Room (IRL)]], it is sad, unkept and dusty. 
- Its mirror is dusty too
- The cardboard box where Karam usually keeps his cleaning tools is empty.
- [[Wardrobe]] **is unordinary**, with a lock on it.
Has one mossy bottle. Which is a big contrast to the 37 bottles in [[Karam's Room (IRL)]]. It may be a Deltarune reference to Kris eating moss.


- Contains the [[Pong]] minigame
